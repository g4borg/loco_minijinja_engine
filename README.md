# Minijinja Engine for Loco.rs

This crate allows you to integrate [Minijinja](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja) as Template renderer into [Loco.rs](https://github.com/loco-rs/loco)

Note: Tera will probably still stay a dependency for your app if you switch Template Engine, so switching to minijinja is really just about preference.
